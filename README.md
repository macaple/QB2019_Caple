I am excited to be learning R and git-- many of my friends are programmers, and I will be able to talk to them better after this! In my free time I enjoy cooking and rock climbing. I drink a lot of tea.

Course Expectations

2. Become comfortable with git and GitHub
3. Learn a variety of methods for analyzing quantitative ecological data
